run TSP.py for the main algorithm to start.

at the start of the code for TSP.py in line 37 the name of the text file can be modified , I put TSP_Uruguay_734.txt as the name , but can be changed to the sahara one.

Please note that because of our Modified Island Model , two populations will evolve , so after the first one ends a new one will  start but the second one will end much faster due to it having information from the first population.
